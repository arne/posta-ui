# The user interface for Posta.no

A lemmy frontend built for `posta.no`. We're building a pretty opinionated clean interface, so we will not have a myriad of options. If you're looking for configurability you should check out [lemmy-ui](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-ui)

## Developing

Install dependencies with `yarn`, ensure you have a reference to the api you're using in `.env` then
start a development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
yarn build
```
